# ATmega328PB Arduino Libraries

## Installation

Install the latest 1.8.6 Arduino version (this is required for the latest board manager tools to install).

Add the following URL to the Arduino Boards Manager (File->Preferences):

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enviroeye/Arduino-ATMEGA328PB/master/package_m328pb_index.json

Update the Arduino AVR Boards to version 1.6.22 or higher via the Boards Manager (Tools->Boards->Boards Manager). This is important, otherwise the sketch won't compile.

Install the ATmega328PB Boards via the Boards Manager (Tools->Boards->Boards Manager).

To compile just select ATmega328PB Internal Clock as the board to build against and the appropriate COM port.
